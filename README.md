## About
- this repository contains the necessary sources to create a declarative agent for Copilot Chat which delivers example prompts to users for one month (31 days)
- every single day is stuffed with a topic and a prompt example
- current instruction is meant to work from 1st until last day of a month - ending in a fabulous final including the creation of a medal üèÖ
- to make interaction more engaging the agent also thows a random historic event that happened on the current day

## Remarks
- sources currently only available in German - but feel free to translate - also possible to ask the agent to please change to your preferred language and it does so
- as the instructions are simple - feel free to adapt as needed to meet your orgs needs (best: use simple mathematical actions for this to make sure it works properly)
- as you are going to set up a solely web grounded, declarative only agent it should work free of charge even without M365 Copilot license (no guarantees, see complementary links below)
- the agent solely uses already available M365 Copilot Chat functionality - nothing added - nothing worked through
- as no internal information is being worked with - only the instructions and web information - there shouldn't be any demands around addtl. data protection or works council approval (no guarantte, make sure to involve everyone needed timely and fair)

## Howto
- _download_ the sourcefile
- check the contents and change as you wish (main functionality is given through schema and instructions, just focus on chaning the contents to not mess it up ‚úåÔ∏è)
- open the M365 Copilot _agent builder tool of your choice_ - Copilot Studio lite is completely sufficient (Unsure? Check sources on the bottom)
- _Name_ the agent (be creative, your users should enjoy the interaction)
- Enter your agent _description_ (sample within the source document)
- copy the _agent body_ part of the sourcefile (or your adjusted version) into the instruction space
- copy the _start / sample messages_ into the corresponding place
- make it fun, give it a nice _icon_ people will love
- click _create_
- have a first _testrun_ and share with a limited amount of people
- _deploy_ to your org: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/manage/manage-copilot-agents-integrated-apps?view=o365-worldwide
- _pint it_ to create maximum visibility https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/manage/manage-pinning-agents?view=o365-worldwide
- send out some communication and inform your champions to make sure your message reaches as many users as possible
- make sure to not only set up and deploy an agent - make your orgs workplace AI journey successful through communication, collaboration and fun - collect all the medals created (this happens on the last day of the challenge) on one single place and let the community decide which one should go through the 3D printer
