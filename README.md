# About
- this repository contains the necessary sources to create a declarative agent for Copilot Chat which delivers example prompts to users for one month (31 days)
- every single day is stuffed with a topic and a prompt example
- current instruction is meant to work from 1st until last day of a month - ending in a fabulous final including the creation of a medal üèÖ
- as the instructions are simple - feel free to adapt as needed to meet your orgs needs (best: use simple mathematical actions for this to make sure it works properly)
- as you are going to set up a solely web grounded, declarative only, agent it should work free of charge even without M365 Copilot license (no guarantees, see complementary links below)

# Howto
- download the sourcefile
- check the contents and change as you wish (main functionality is given through schema and instructions, just focus on chaning the contents to not mess it up ‚úåÔ∏è)
- open the M365 Copilot agent builder tool of your choice - Copilot Studio lite is completely sufficient (Unsure? Check sources on the bottom)
- <<Name>> the agent (be creative, your users should enjoy the interaction)
- Enter your agent <<description>> (sample within the source document)
- copy the <<agent body>> part of the sourcefile (or your adjusted version) into the instruction space
- make it fun, give it a nice <<icon>> people will love
- click <<create>>
- have a first testrun and share with a limited amount of people
- <<deploy>> to your org: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/manage/manage-copilot-agents-integrated-apps?view=o365-worldwide
- <<pint it>> to create maximum visibility https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/manage/manage-pinning-agents?view=o365-worldwide
- send out some communication and inform your champions to make sure your message reaches as many users as possible
- make sure to not only set up and deploy an agent - make your orgs workplace AI journey successful through communication, collaboration and fun - collect all the medals created (this happens on the last day of the challenge) on one single place and let the community decide which one should go through the 3D printer
